*Open Source Software (OSS)* is software with publicly available source code, allowing anyone to inspect, modify, and enhance it.

*Key Principles:*
- *Freedom to Use*: No restrictions on usage.
- *Freedom to Study*: Access to source code.
- *Freedom to Modify*: Change the code to suit your needs.
- *Freedom to Share*: Distribute your versions.

Linux is licensed under the *GNU General Public License (GPL)*, which ensures these freedoms.
